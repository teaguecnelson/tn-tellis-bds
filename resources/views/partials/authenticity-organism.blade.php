          <p>I'm Gaye, just an ordinary gal trying to make sense of our changing world.  I am addicted to prepping, DIY projects, adult coloring books, and ballroom dancing.  I live what I call a strategic life and believe you should too.  Everyone needs to prepare for the worst and live for the best. Won't you join me?</p>
